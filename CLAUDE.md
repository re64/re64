# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/claude-code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

re64 is a C64 disassembler. The long-term goal is a collaborative web-based tool with CRDT support for real-time collaboration. Currently it's a local CLI tool in active development.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `src/core/` - Platform-agnostic code shared between CLI and future web UI
- `src/cli/` - Command-line interface using Commander
- `assets/` - Example files and project configurations
- Future: `src/server/` and `src/ui/` directories

Keep core/ free of Node.js-specific APIs where possible to maintain web compatibility.

### Conceptual Model

The system has three layers of abstraction:

**1. Memory Map & Layers** - The "physical" layer
- `MemoryMap` contains stacked `Layer` objects (FileLayer, BytesLayer)
- Layers provide actual bytes, stack and shadow each other (top wins)
- This is the raw data being analyzed

**2. Regions** - Semantic "what is this?"
- Define what a range of memory *means* (code, data, text, jumptable, unknown)
- Not backed by bytes - they overlay the memory map
- Sources:
  - Auto-generated from layers via `defaultRegionKind` (PRG→code, raw→data)
  - User-defined in project file (finer granularity, overrides auto)
- Guide the disassembler on how to interpret bytes

**3. Labels** - Semantic "what is this called?"
- Mark individual addresses with names
- Sources:
  - Layer-generated (PRG entry points)
  - Region-generated (named region start addresses)
  - User-defined in project file
- Resolved in instruction operands (e.g., `JSR ROM_CHROUT` instead of `JSR $FFD2`)

```

### Disassembler Design

The 6502 disassembler uses a work-queue approach:
1. Start with entry points in the queue
2. Decode instruction at queue head
3. Add control flow targets (branches, jumps, fall-through) to queue
4. Skip addresses in non-code regions
5. Continue until queue is empty

This discovers all reachable code without disassembling data as instructions.

## Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode compilation
- `npm run typecheck` - Type check without emitting

## Testing

Tests live alongside source files with `.test.ts` suffix. Use vitest.

## Guidelines

- Minimal dependencies - only add packages when clearly beneficial
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Keep abstractions simple until complexity is needed
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled

## Documentation

- Use TSDoc (`/** */`) for public interfaces and classes
- Document "why", not "what" - let types speak for themselves
- Keep comments minimal; add them for non-obvious design decisions or C64-specific knowledge
- Don't restate what the code or types already say

## Project Files

Project files (`.re64`) are JSON with this schema:

```typescript
interface Project {
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
  layers: ProjectLayer[];      // Required: file layers to load
  entryPoints?: (number | string)[];  // Disassembly entry points
  labels?: ProjectLabel[];     // User-defined labels
  regions?: ProjectRegion[];   // User-defined regions
}

interface ProjectLayer {
  type: "prg" | "raw" | "bytes";
  path?: string;        // For prg/raw
  address?: number | string;  // For raw/bytes
  bytes?: string;       // Hex string for bytes type
  length?: number;      // Optional length for repeat/fill
  noAutoEntry?: boolean;  // Suppress auto entry point for PRG
}

interface ProjectLabel {
  address: number | string;  // "$8000" or 32768
  name: string;
  type?: "entry" | "address";  // Default: "address"
}

interface ProjectRegion {
  start: number | string;
  end: number | string;   // Can use "+length" format: "+$100"
  kind: "code" | "data" | "text" | "jumptable" | "unknown";
  name?: string;
}
```

Addresses can be decimal (32768) or hex strings ("$8000", "0x8000").

## Known Limitations & Future Features

### Text Region Rendering
Text regions currently display raw bytes with `.TEXT` directive. Many C64 games use custom character sets with proprietary encodings (not standard PETSCII or screen codes). To properly decode text, one would need to analyze the game's character set glyph data.

**Future feature idea:** Allow custom renderers as JavaScript snippets in the project file. Users could define decoding functions that map bytes to display characters based on the game's specific charset. This would enable proper text display for games with custom fonts.
