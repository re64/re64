# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/claude-code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

re64 is a C64 disassembler. The long-term goal is a collaborative web-based tool with CRDT support for real-time collaboration. Currently it's a local CLI tool in active development.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

- `src/core/` - Platform-agnostic code shared between CLI and future web UI
- `src/cli/` - Command-line interface using Commander
- `assets/` - Example files and project configurations
- Future: `src/server/` and `src/ui/` directories

Keep core/ free of Node.js-specific APIs where possible to maintain web compatibility.

### Conceptual Model

The system has three layers of abstraction:

**1. Memory Map & Layers** - The "physical" layer
- `MemoryMap` contains stacked `Layer` objects (FileLayer, BytesLayer)
- Layers provide actual bytes, stack and shadow each other (top wins)
- This is the raw data being analyzed

**2. Regions** - Semantic "what is this?"
- Define what a range of memory *means* (code, data, text, jumptable, unknown)
- Not backed by bytes - they overlay the memory map
- Sources:
  - Auto-generated from layers via `defaultRegionKind` (PRG→code, raw→data)
  - User-defined in project file (finer granularity, overrides auto)
- Guide the disassembler on how to interpret bytes

**3. Labels** - Semantic "what is this called?"
- Mark individual addresses with names
- Sources:
  - Layer-generated (PRG entry points)
  - Region-generated (named region start addresses)
  - User-defined in project file
- Resolved in instruction operands (e.g., `JSR ROM_CHROUT` instead of `JSR $FFD2`)

```

### Disassembler Design

The 6502 disassembler uses a work-queue approach:
1. Start with entry points in the queue
2. Decode instruction at queue head
3. Add control flow targets (branches, jumps, fall-through) to queue
4. Skip addresses in non-code regions
5. Continue until queue is empty

This discovers all reachable code without disassembling data as instructions.

## Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript
- `npm test` - Run tests once
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode compilation
- `npm run typecheck` - Type check without emitting

## Testing

Tests live alongside source files with `.test.ts` suffix. Use vitest.

## Guidelines

- Minimal dependencies - only add packages when clearly beneficial
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Keep abstractions simple until complexity is needed
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled

## Documentation

- Use TSDoc (`/** */`) for public interfaces and classes
- Document "why", not "what" - let types speak for themselves
- Keep comments minimal; add them for non-obvious design decisions or C64-specific knowledge
- Don't restate what the code or types already say

## Project Files

Project files (`.re64`) are JSON with this schema:

```typescript
interface Project {
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
  layers: ProjectLayer[];      // Required: file layers to load
  entryPoints?: (number | string)[];  // Disassembly entry points
  labels?: ProjectLabel[];     // User-defined labels
  regions?: ProjectRegion[];   // User-defined regions
}

interface ProjectLayer {
  type: "prg" | "raw" | "bytes";
  path?: string;        // For prg/raw
  address?: number | string;  // For raw/bytes
  bytes?: string;       // Hex string for bytes type
  length?: number;      // Optional length for repeat/fill
  noAutoEntry?: boolean;  // Suppress auto entry point for PRG
}

interface ProjectLabel {
  address: number | string;  // "$8000" or 32768
  name: string;
  type?: "entry" | "function" | "code" | "address";  // Default: "address"
  comment?: string;
}

interface ProjectRegion {
  start: number | string;
  end: number | string;   // Can use "+length" format: "+$100"
  kind: "code" | "data" | "text" | "jumptable" | "unknown";
  name?: string;
  comment?: string;
}
```

Addresses can be decimal (32768) or hex strings ("$8000", "0x8000").

## UI Design Decisions

The eventual web UI is built around a single central widget: a disassembly view
holding assembler lines, comments, cross-reference arrows, and inline editable
elements (labels, comments). These decisions are recorded here because they
constrain the core data model, not just the presentation layer.

### Model-is-truth, not buffer-is-truth

The displayed text is *derived* from the three-layer model (bytes → regions →
labels). Users never type assembler; they edit specific fields — a label's name,
a comment, a region's kind. Therefore:

- The document is a list of rows keyed by **address**, not a text buffer.
- CRDT sync operates on the project model (`labels`, `comments`, `regions`) —
  the same structures already in the `.re64` schema — never on characters.
- Two users renaming the same label is a clean conflict on one field, rather
  than overlapping character edits in a generated string.

Rejected alternative: holding generated text in an editor buffer and parsing
edits back. That round-trips derived text through a parser and puts conflicts at
the wrong granularity.

### Widget: CodeMirror 6, read-only with decorations

Chosen over a hand-rolled virtualized list mainly because of **variable row
heights**. Inline multiline editing (a block comment expanding in place) breaks
naive virtualization: rows growing above the viewport cause scroll jump unless
anchoring is handled explicitly. CodeMirror 6's height map already handles
variable-height lines (soft wrapping produces them constantly) and anchors
scroll position across height changes.

What it provides:
- Virtualization — a full 64K map is tens of thousands of rows.
- Block widgets for multiline inline editors and standalone comment rows.
- Inline widgets for editable label tokens.
- Atomic/read-only ranges so generated assembler text is not directly editable.
- Gutters, for the cross-reference arrow layer.

Consequence: **edit inline, not in popups.** Block comments expand in place as
block widgets; label renames are in-place token editors. Popups/overlays are
reserved for things genuinely outside document flow — the aggregated xref list,
a region-kind picker.

Label editing uses both widget forms, picked by whether a label already exists:

- **Renaming** replaces the label token with an input (`Decoration.replace`), so
  the trailing `:` and xref stub stay put and the row does not reflow.
- **Naming a new address** has no token to replace, so the editor gets its own
  block row above the instruction (`Decoration.widget({block: true})`), indented
  to the label column — the row it is about to become.

Enter commits, Escape reverts, and **blur reverts rather than saving**: an empty
name means "delete this label", so a blur-commit would turn an accidentally
cleared field into a silent deletion.

Two gotchas worth remembering:

- A read-only view (`EditorView.editable.of(false)`) is **not focusable**. Without
  `contentAttributes: {tabindex: "0"}`, clicking a line leaves the keymap with no
  listener and every shortcut silently does nothing.
- Widgets holding form controls must return `true` from `ignoreEvent()` and stop
  propagation on keydown, or the editor's own keymap eats the typing.

Operands pointing outside the loaded map — zero-page variables, I/O registers,
KERNAL entry points — render as plain grey names rather than links. They are
named but have no bytes, and on 6502 they are common enough that making them
clickable means constantly landing on an error.

### Label types are backend concepts; the UI exposes one

The four label types are genuinely distinct concepts, even though the
disassembler currently treats three of them identically (all get queued):

- `entry` — where execution *starts*. Emitted by a layer or region, not by the
  user: a PRG layer sets `defaultRegionKind = "code"` and labels its load
  address. No caller, no return contract.
- `function` — a subroutine, from analysis (a JSR target) or declared by the
  user. Has callers and a return contract.
- `code` — a branch or jump target found by analysis. Intra-function.
- `address` — a named address, not queued. The default.

Do **not** collapse these because they behave alike today. That sameness is an
artifact of the disassembler only ever queueing them; they diverge as soon as
there is call-graph or basic-block analysis, which is where the information
would be needed and no longer recoverable.

The UI exposes only `function` (`f`), because that is the one a user reaches
for while reading code — promoting a `loc_` they have recognised as a
subroutine, or declaring one nothing references so it gets decoded at all.
`entry` and `code` render as read-only tags so the analysis stays visible. The
project file remains the escape hatch for anything else, including
hand-written `code` labels. General capability in the backend, common cases in
the front end.

Auto-generated names encode their type in the prefix:

```
sub_XXXX → function    loc_XXXX → code    dat_XXXX → address
```

So promoting an auto label renames `loc_XXXX` to `sub_XXXX`; leaving the old
prefix would contradict the tag. This cannot collide with auto-labelling,
because an auto name always encodes its own address and any existing label at
that address suppresses generation there (`allLabels.resolve(...)` short-circuits
the loop). Clearing `function` from a label still carrying an auto-shaped name
deletes it outright rather than leaving a redundant untyped entry; a name the
user chose is kept and only its type is cleared.

### Cross-reference arrow rendering

Two distinct styles, to keep the gutter from filling with long parallel lines:

**Nested margin arrows** for local references. 6502 relative branches are
limited to −128..+127 bytes (~40–60 instructions), so a `branch` reference is
*structurally* guaranteed local and always renders nested. Absolute `call`,
`jump`, and `data` references are usually distant.

**Open-ended stubs** for distant references: a short stub with a label, click to
jump. Both directions must be rendered — outbound (`▸ DrawGrid`) at the source,
inbound (`◂ from $8A12`) at the target. The inbound side is what reveals "this
routine has callers" when sitting at a function head.

Rules:
- **Classify by address distance, never by viewport.** Viewport-dependent
  classification makes arrows flip style while scrolling, reflowing the gutter
  and shuffling lane assignments under the cursor. Distance-based
  classification is model-derived, stable, and cacheable; nested arrows simply
  clip at the viewport edge.
- Threshold ~100 rows. Given the ISA, this only arbitrates same-page `JMP`s and
  near data references.
- **Lane allocation** is interval-overlap, ordered **shortest span first**: each
  arrow takes the innermost lane no overlapping arrow already holds. Ordering by
  length is what produces correct nesting — an arrow contained inside another is
  necessarily shorter, so it claims the inner lane and forces its container
  outward. Do *not* sweep by start address: that classic interval-graph greedy
  uses fewer lanes but inverts nesting, because an enclosing arrow that merely
  begins earlier steals the inner lane from the short arrow inside it.
  Endpoints touching counts as overlap, since two corners would land in one
  cell. Cap at 4–6 lanes; anything needing more demotes to a stub, which is what
  permanently bounds gutter width. Long arrows demote first under this ordering,
  which is the intended bias.
- **Aggregate hot targets.** A common subroutine may have dozens of inbound
  references; collapse to a single `◂ 14 refs` stub opening a popover list.
- Stub labels use the target's resolved label name, falling back to the address.
- Clicking a stub pushes onto a **navigation stack** — back-jump is the most-used
  key in any disassembler.
- Data references get no arrow at all. Only control flow (branch/jump/call) is
  drawn; data refs would fill the margin with noise.

Lane allocation and gutter rendering live in `src/server/analysis.ts`
(`allocateArrowLanes`, `renderArrowGutter`) — model-derived, so it belongs on
the server rather than in the view. The gutter arrives as one pre-rendered
string per row, kept out of the document so copying disassembly does not drag
box-drawing characters along.

One rendering gotcha: box-drawing glyphs fill their em box, not the taller line
box, so unscaled verticals show a gap at every row boundary. The gutter span is
stretched with `scaleY` to make segments meet.

## Known Limitations & Future Features

### Text Region Rendering
Text regions currently display raw bytes with `.TEXT` directive. Many C64 games use custom character sets with proprietary encodings (not standard PETSCII or screen codes). To properly decode text, one would need to analyze the game's character set glyph data.

**Future feature idea:** Allow custom renderers as JavaScript snippets in the project file. Users could define decoding functions that map bytes to display characters based on the game's specific charset. This would enable proper text display for games with custom fonts.
